## 2\. Python Collections: Mastering Advanced Data Structures 🗄️

This section covers efficient ways to structure and manipulate data, which is crucial when handling large datasets, API responses, and database records.

### 1\. Advanced Lists: List Comprehensions (LCs)

List Comprehensions are powerful syntactic sugar for creating lists. They are a concise alternative to the traditional `for` loop + `.append()` pattern.

| Component | Description | Example (from `[x * 2 for x in data if x > 5]`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Expression** | The result you want to calculate for each item. | `x * 2` (The doubling operation) |
| **Iteration** | The standard `for` loop that cycles through the source data. | `for x in data` |
| **Filter (Optional)**| A conditional statement that acts as a gate. Only items that satisfy this condition are passed to the Expression. | `if x > 5` |

#### **Code Structure Example:**

```python
# Traditional Loop (Verbose)
old_list = []
for number in range(10):
    if number % 3 == 0:
        old_list.append(number ** 2)

# List Comprehension (Concise and Fast)
new_list = [number ** 2 for number in range(10) if number % 3 == 0]

print(new_list) # Output: [0, 9, 36, 81] (0, 3, 6, 9 squared)
```

#### **The Performance Advantage (How LCs are Faster):**

List Comprehensions are not just about neatness; they offer significant performance gains over manually calling `.append()` in a loop.

1.  **Reduced Overhead:** LCs are designed to execute closer to the Python interpreter's **$\text{C}$ layer**. The entire loop, expression, and filter are often processed as a single operation (`BUILD_LIST_FROM_ITER`).
2.  **No Repeated Lookups:** In a traditional loop, Python must repeatedly look up the **`.append()` method** on the list object in the namespace during every iteration. LCs bypass this slow, repetitive name resolution step.
3.  **Better Memory Management:** The Python interpreter can often **calculate or estimate the final size** of the list before execution begins. This allows for a more efficient, single memory allocation, avoiding the overhead of multiple, dynamic resizing operations that occur when repeatedly calling `.append()`.

### 2\. Dictionaries: Essential Methods and Comprehensions

Dictionaries are key for backend work, primarily for their $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (constant time) lookup speed and their direct mapping to **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

#### **Crucial Methods for Data Handling:**

| Method | Syntax | Detailed Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`.get(key, default)`**| `dict.get('port', 8080)` | **Safe Access:** Prevents a program crash (`KeyError`) if a required key is missing. This is vital when processing external data (APIs, user forms). |
| **`.update(other_dict)`**| `user.update(new_data)` | **Merging/Patching:** Efficiently merges key-value pairs from the `other_dict` into the current one, overwriting existing keys and adding new ones. |
| **`.items()`** | `for k, v in dict.items():` | **Efficient Iteration:** Returns a **view object** of `(key, value)` tuples. Using `.items()` is the standard, memory-efficient way to loop over both key and value simultaneously. |
| **`.pop(key, default)`**| `dict.pop('temp_key', None)`| Removes the specified `key` and returns its value. The optional `default` value is returned if the key isn't found, preventing an error. |

#### **Dictionary Comprehensions:**

Just like lists, you can create dictionaries concisely.

**Syntax:** `  {key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable [if condition]} `

```python
names = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
# Dictionary mapping name to its length
name_lengths = {name: len(name) for name in names}
# Output: {'alice': 5, 'bob': 3, 'charlie': 7}
```

### 3\. The `collections` Module

The standard containers (`list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`) are general-purpose. The `collections` module provides highly optimized, specialized containers.

#### **A. `defaultdict` (The Error-Proof Dictionary)**

A specialized dictionary that never raises a `KeyError` on a missing key.

  * **Mechanism:** When initialized, you provide a factory function (e.g., `list`, `int`, `set`). If a key is accessed and not found, the factory function is called to supply a default value, which is then inserted into the dictionary.

  * **Use Case:** Ideal for **Grouping** and **Counting**.

<!-- end list -->

```python
from collections import defaultdict
# Default factory is list: missing keys get an empty list
groups = defaultdict(list)

data = [('A', 1), ('B', 2), ('A', 3)]

for key, value in data:
    groups[key].append(value) # No need to check if 'A' or 'B' exists

# Output: defaultdict(<class 'list'>, {'A': [1, 3], 'B': [2]})
```

#### **B. `Counter` (The High-Speed Tally Tool)**

A specialized subclass of `dict` optimized for counting the frequency of hashable objects.

  * **Initialization:** Can be initialized directly from any iterable (list, string, etc.).

  * **Access:** Keys are the items, and values are their counts.

  * **Key Method:** **`.most_common(n)`** returns a list of the $N$ most common items and their counts as `(item, count)` tuples.

<!-- end list -->

```python
from collections import Counter
log_events = ["ERROR", "INFO", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "INFO"]

tally = Counter(log_events)

print(tally)                   # Output: Counter({'INFO': 3, 'ERROR': 2, 'WARN': 1})
print(tally.most_common(1))    # Output: [('INFO', 3)]
```

#### **C. `namedtuple` (Immutable Records)**

Creates a lightweight, immutable object with named fields, acting like a simplified, memory-efficient class.

  * **Advantage:** **Readability** and **Self-Documentation**. It allows you to access data by name (`record.user_id`) instead of brittle, hard-to-remember indices (`record[0]`).
  * **Immutability:** Its values cannot be changed after creation, making it safe for passing data across different parts of a large application.

<!-- end list -->

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define the structure and field names
DBRecord = namedtuple('DBRecord', ['user_id', 'username', 'last_seen'])

# Create an instance
user = DBRecord(user_id=42, username='dev_bob', last_seen='2025-10-27')

# Access is clear and safe
print(user.username)
```
